# CatAndMouse

This repo contains a rough draft of a Cat and Mouse game I'm developing. The gist of the game is that a mouse is traveling through a maze and can encounter obstacles like dead ends.. or CATS. Once spotted, the mouse will be followed by the cat unless it can evade its path. If the mouse is sucessful, the game is won. This game was developed using the SFML framework and C++. Future developments for this game include developing graphics/rendering, implementing the logic for dead-ends and traveling through the maze, creating different levels of difficulty and logic to prevent the cat from attacking the mouse (such as the mouse traveling near water). 

Below is a my brainstorming pad when I began to think about how I wanted to implement this game
